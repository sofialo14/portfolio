          <h1>Hi everyone,</h1>
          <p>My name is Sofia, and I'm a senior at the University of Michigan. Last year, I had the incredible opportunity of studying abroad in Florence for the semester. Throughout my time there, I was able to explore the city, learning about its unique history, indulging in authentic meals, and visiting cultural sites. I hope everyone has the chance to visit Florence, and I am providing this guide to share some of my favorite views, cultural destinations, and restaurants. I hope this helps others plan trips to Florence and make the most of their travels.</p>

                <p>I am a senior at the University of Michigan in the School of Information studying User Experience Design. I chose to pursue the UX Design path because Iâ€™m interested in learning about the intersection of business and technology, understanding how to problem-solve and seeing the impact of technology and effective design on businesses and people alike.</p>

                <p>In my free time, I enjoy hanging out with my friends and family, listening to music, dancing, solving puzzles, and playing games. I'm always looking to problem-solve and explore, which I think is the most exciting way to live. I also love to travel, seeing new sights and embracing new cultures along the way. One of my favorite places that I have travelled is Florence, Italy, which is why I decided to dedicate this portfolio to the city.</p>
